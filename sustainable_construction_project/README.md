# Sustainable Construction Project Coordination

## Objective
Help a project team identify early schedule slippage and cost pressure, and understand how sustainability measures affect delivery trade-offs.

## Context
The dataset represents construction-related activity across one or more projects, including timing, cost, and performance indicators. The analysis is framed from the perspective of a project coordinator supporting delivery decisions under real constraints.

## Key Questions
- Where are delays emerging, and what patterns explain them?
- Which cost overruns pose the highest risk to delivery?
- How do sustainability indicators (energy efficiency, materials, waste) interact with timeline and cost?
- What actions should a project coordinator prioritize?

## Planned Outputs
- Schedule and cost performance overview
- Risk signals and trade-off analysis
- Sustainability impact summary
- Clear, practical recommendations
