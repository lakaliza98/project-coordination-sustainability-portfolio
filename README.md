# Project Coordination & Sustainability Analytics Portfolio

A project coordination and sustainability analytics portfolio showcasing how data supports planning, prioritization, and delivery decisions.

## About
I’m a business analyst with a project coordination focus, using data to improve delivery decisions and sustainability outcomes.

This repository contains project-style case studies built with real-world datasets. Each project is framed like a real engagement: define the problem, understand constraints, analyze trade-offs, and recommend actions a team could realistically take.

## Focus Areas
- Schedule and delivery performance
- Cost and resource trade-offs
- Risk signals and decision support
- Sustainability and ESG-related outcomes

## Tools
- Excel
- SQL
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Power BI / Tableau

## Projects
1. Sustainable Construction Project Coordination — *in progress*
